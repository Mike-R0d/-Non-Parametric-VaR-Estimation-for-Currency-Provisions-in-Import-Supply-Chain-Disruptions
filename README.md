# Non Parametric VaR Estimation for Currency Provisions in Import Supply Chain Disruptions

Project Summary:
The Asset Replacement Project aimed to replace multiple company assets at the best possible price according to the company's replacement plans. The challenge was that many of these assets were imported products with significant import lead times. Externally, the project faced supply chain disruptions caused by the partial closure of global production centers and a high depreciation of the domestic currency. Internally, investment budgets prior to the supply chain disruptions were structured with a certain tolerance for price variations, which had been fixed before the pandemic.

External Context:

Supply Chain Disruptions: The partial closure of global production centers led to a breakdown in the supply chain.
Currency Depreciation: High depreciation of the domestic currency affected the cost of imported goods.
Internal Context:

Pre-Pandemic Budgets: Investment budgets had been structured with a tolerance for price variations based on pre-pandemic conditions.
Challenges:

Recalibration of Budgets: After the reopening of ports, all budget items had to be recalibrated meticulously due to the adjusted import components of the project. This was necessary to re-estimate contingency funds in case of exchange rate spikes.
Methodology:

Value at Risk (VaR): The VaR methodology was used to calculate the maximum loss due to exchange rate differentials over the exposure period.
Non-Parametric Estimation: This was used to determine the theoretical density function of the euro and the dollar.
Outcomes:

Risk Mitigation: Application of the VaR methodology allowed for the reduction of currency risk.
Negotiation of Better Conditions: This methodology facilitated the negotiation of better terms for company purchases.
Cost Avoidance: The project successfully avoided losses amounting to XX million dollars.
Conclusion:
The implementation of sophisticated financial methodologies, such as VaR and non-parametric estimation, enabled the company to navigate external supply chain disruptions and internal budget recalibrations effectively. By mitigating currency risk and securing better purchasing conditions, the company not only maintained its asset replacement plans but also achieved significant cost avoidance.
